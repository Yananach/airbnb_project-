# airbnb_project

### Project Overview

This project aims to find ways to increase bookings on the AIRBNB platform.
With the help of the data we will try to understand in which areas should we invest to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro? 
Which sections are successful and what can be improved? and more.
We will conclude with data-driven recommendations

### Data Sources

The data comes from three different Excel tables.
1.contacts.csv​​
Contains a row for every time that a user makes an inquiry for a stay at a listing in Rio de Janeiro.
2.listings.csv
Contains data for every listing in the market
3.Users
Contains data for every user

### Tools

Excel - Analysis and visualization
SQL Server - Data Analysis
PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data cleaning and formatting.
Join all 3 together into 1 giant master table.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The questions we would like to answer:
1.What key metrics would you propose to monitor over time the success of the team’s efforts in improving the guest host matching process and why?
2.What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro? What segments are doing well and what could be improved? 

### Results/Findings

- “Contact Me” performs poorly for this channel the abandonment rate is very high.
- the more host/guest interaction it has a positive effect on both parties, hosts are more likely to accept bookings and guests are more likely to book.
- there is an effect on the number of characters for intelligence, the chances of response and acceptance by the host.
- high abandonment rates when the neighborhood is unknown.
- As the number of responses increases, we see that the rate of conversion to an order increases.

### Recommendations

- Remove the “Contact Me” flow altogether in favor of “Book It” and “Instant Book” (where available).
- Require hosts to respond to initial message and encourage active communication between guests and hosts.
- Recommend that guests leave a certain number of characters.
- Change the listing neighborhood to mandatory.
- encourage customers to write comments. 
- Let customers rate the properties and create a general rating.
